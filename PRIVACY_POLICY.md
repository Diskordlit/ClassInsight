# ClassInsight Pro Privacy Policy

## Overview

Welcome to ClassInsight Pro!<br> This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our browser extension.

## Information We Collect

### Personal Information

For the application to function as intended, transcripts of the video would need to be analyzed. This may include information such as:
- Names of speakers in the video
- Transcribed conversations between speakers in the video
- Audio extracted from the video _(only in the event that the video does not already have a transcript)_

## How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information for the following purposes:
- **Conversion of the audio file from the video into a transcript that can be understood by Azure OpenAI** _(only if the video does not already have a transcript in Microsoft Stream)_
- **Storing in our Azure Cosmos DB database to allow seamless questioning for that particular video in the future** _(only if the video does not already have a transcript in Microsoft Stream. This is done for efficiency purposes as transcription can be a long and cost-intensive task)_
- **Transcription be sent to the Azure OpenAI service to understand the context of the video so that it can answer your questions regarding the video**

## Data Security

We prioritize the security of your information and implement appropriate measures to safeguard it. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Sharing Your Information

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to third parties. However, we may share aggregated information such as with Azure OpenAI for the conversational and analytical aspects of the extension.

## Your Choices

You can choose to only use the extension for videos that already have a Microsoft Stream transcription or uninstall the extension if you no longer wish to use our service.

## Updates to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. We will notify users of any material changes by updating the "Last Updated" date. <br>
The version history of this markdown file would be proof of our changes over time.
